          What started just a few days ago (late April, 2021) as a google doc
          with a list of links, has grown through social media and hard work, to
          a rag-tag operation with over 30 volunteers, with protocols and
          guidelines and statements of ethics. As we have grown and put some
          structure to our labour, we wanted to share with you, the public
          (hopefully the donor or the volunteer) what it is, and the values that
          drive it.

          We vet and track everything we add to the website.{' '}

          That said, We are not a formal organization, so please donâ€™t treat us
          or this website as one. We are doing our best to support mutual aid in
          these terrible times. Our priority is to support vulnerable people,
          and we do not ask for photos as "evidence" &ndash; since this
          requirement of proof of suffering goes against our ethics. We are not
          a formal NGO with a staff who chases down every Rupee spent and gives
          "charity" with these strings attached. Such NGO will naturally
          establish barriers that the most disadvantaged members of society will
          not be able to scale. It is our hope that the practice of mutual aid
          can be a way to fill in that gap, rather than to recreate it.
